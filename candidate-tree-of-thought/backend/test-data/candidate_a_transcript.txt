  3:58
  Candidate A: Yeah. So I worked within, at Advent, I worked mostly at, home goods retail stores similar to, like, Home Depot here in The US. And within financial services specifically, I worked in the credit card part for both acquirers, also brands, credit card brand, and a credit card issuer. So all of these these three different main verticals for credit cards, were, parts that I worked with. I helped increase the number of shops that accepted a specific credit card for one of the portfolio companies, and that has increased you know, the revenue and the access for for clients by more than, 65%. I also helped issue different credit card by creating a loyalty program within another one of the portfolio companies, and this has helped you know, increase, transactions and the retention. With the credit card customers over there. I have helped You know, in the, financial transaction to improve, you know, the the value added for some of these portfolio companies. So that they could later have, you know, either an acquisition by a different, private equity fund or an IPO, which is actually what happened with the largest company that I worked with. We had an IPO happen for largest cat of cattle. In 2019, I think it was. And, it was a really great, you know, success for the fund and for Advent in general.

  5:31

  1. Increasing credit card acceptance by 65% for one portfolio company
  2. Developing a loyalty program that improved customer retention
  3. Contributing to a successful IPO for a major portfolio company in 2019
  Could you walk me through a specific example of how you approached one of these projects? What were some of the key challenges you faced, and how did you work with the management team to drive these improvements?

  6:14
  Candidate A: Definitely. I'm happy to share little bit more about the project where I launched this, loyalty program. Within, virtual card. Which is the the name of the portfolio company. And over there, there was a resistance on creating a any kind of loyalty program or any kind of tier ranked system. Because of the the kinds of customers and the the customer research that existed before. So, basically, the the most of the customers were in the older side, like, in the, in the countryside areas of Brazil. And they wanted to have, you know, a more according to research that was done before, more equal experience, and they didn't want to, you know, just be kind of be separated and excluded. For from, different perks. What I actually learned from doing interviews with many different, customers interviewing store managers, you know, branch managers, and also running focus groups. Is that as long as the specific criteria, too rich you know, a different kind of credit card with a, you know, kinda like a black or, like, like, like, a special credit card was not just paying a larger annuity amount and not necessarily for people with with larger credit scores, but it was actually based on the usage of the of the the card, frequency, which were all metrics that we were looking to improve anyway, then most customers were actually okay with the creation of this loyalty program. So I brought this to management. I also brought the, different plans and ideas that I had, you know, working together with the marketing team, working together with operations and and, even store managers directly to create a set of criteria to define, you know, these different loyalty tiers. What kinds of benefits we could give to them. So a business case was created for each one of the different potential benefits. I brought this to the director's board within the portfolio company. And then after we got approval from the directors, from from the board of directors, we we actually brought this to the partners within Advent to get an approval to implement that as well. So I was able to convince using, you know, all of this data that I that I collected and and the the proposal went ahead with a limited number of benefits. As a pilot in some regions in Brazil. It was a success because Customers really improved their frequency, retention, and transaction value. And we were actually able to get customers that were not in that category to want to have this new car and and to get these new perks. To use the card more than use other methods of payment. So it was a really big success, and I was very, proud of that. Achievement. And it would not have been possible if if, you know, there was no, acceptance within the director's board. And, and the this research still led to to the decision.
