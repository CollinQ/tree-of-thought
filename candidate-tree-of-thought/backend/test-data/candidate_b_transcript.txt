Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of questions about your professional background and a case study based on your work experience. Are you ready to start the interview?

0:13

I'm ready.

0:15

Great! Let's get started. I see that you've led omni-channel marketing and go-to-market strategies for several industries. Could you tell me about a specific project where you utilized data visualization to identify areas for change and revenue growth? What tools did you use, and what was the outcome of that project?

0:35

Yes. One of the projects I've done something like that would happened to be a smaller pharmaceutical company that was looking to expand and seeing where the potential was. For them to be able to do so. They provided me with information based on they normally sell to and who their current HCP clients are. And through that information and being able to use, things like Tableau along with, Salesforce .com. And actually be able to see and develop a model to show them not only where they could go and expand, but also where they could go and try just a different set a different set of being able to utilize their skills to gain new clients. So they were able to expand in the area that they were looking to expand in as well as go into a separate separate area and be able to sell to a different set of HCPs who were interested in their particular product.

1:40

Thank you for sharing that. It's interesting to hear how you integrated data visualization tools like Tableau with platforms like Salesforce to drive strategic decisions. Can you elaborate on the model you developed for this project? Specifically, what data points or metrics did you focus on to support your recommendations?

1:59

Sure. The data points I was looking at were the type of HEPs. In this particular case, what type of physicians, how they shared commonalities with other and I even brought in, some graph database software Neo 4j in this case, to be able to make some connections So this way, I could see the connections between one type of physician and the other and be able to see the type scripts they wrote how often they wrote them, and who they wrote them to to be able to determine where there would be another of HCPs that they could go and reach out to with this particular medication.

2:38

It sounds like you used quite a comprehensive approach with some advanced tools like Neo4j to analyze complex networks of connections. How did your team incorporate these insights into the marketing strategy for the pharmaceutical client? What kind of impact did your recommendations have on their brand awareness or sales?

2:56

sales, with new HCPs, which increased their revenue, I believe, about How was I able to integrate it? Oh, well, again, I took data from there and being able to pull it from there and from Salesforce and be able to use it in Tableau to show more graphically how what we were doing and where we needed to go. Was useful for my team so that they didn't have to break down the information in re reorganize it each time. And then being able to present that to the client was something, was just in a way that they were able to understand better about why it made sense to go and allocate budget to target a different segment that they had already targeted. Before. In addition to that, just being able to use those tools and teach others on the team about what the data meant and not to make assumptions on it, and to be able to, actually go and cross check it with other data. Allow them to, again, move into a different type of 5% over what they were expecting.

4:05

It's impressive to hear how you aligned data visualization with strategic decision-making and even used it as an educational tool for your team. It's clear that your work led to measurable growth and a shift in their marketing approach. Now, could you tell me more about the data science team you managed? Specifically, what were some of the challenges you faced in delivering marketing insights, and how did you address them while ensuring compliance with intellectual property regulations?

4:31

The data science team I manage consisted of about 3 data scientists, a couple of data analysts, and, a marketing analyst. How did I incorporate what I did? What was the second part of the question again?

4:50

The second part was about the challenges you faced in delivering marketing insights and how you addressed those challenges, particularly while ensuring compliance with intellectual property regulations.

5:02

Challenge I'd say one of the biggest challenges was being able to really convey the same message that made sense to us as a team that what the spent to the stakeholders within the company because it wasn't something that they were used to seeing or used to dealing with. So being able to explain that and communicate that in a way that made sense for them so that they were ready to be the change agents for what needed to happen. That's probably the biggest challenge because they were different levels of stakeholders. And different types of areas of the company. And so explaining it one way to, let's say, someone in operations wouldn't be the exact same way you would explain it to the finance team. Like, when it comes to making sure that, we kept in mind what needed to be done in terms of regulations. That's just something that, is automatically done. You never go and push ahead without running it through legal or compliance when it comes to the pharmaceutical like a lot of other industries I've worked in, such as, telecoms, it's something that is automatic. So whether you're working on a new project, whether it's marketing or anything, it must go through legal, and it must go through, yeah, the The basically, the q and a process and cycle first. So, anything I created, anything I did, stayed the intellectual property of the company. And, anything that went out to the public was preapproved in order to do so, not just by the general stakeholders, but specifically by the legal team as well.

6:44

Thank you for explaining those challenges. It sounds like a significant part of your role involved clear and tailored communication with various stakeholders, adapting your approach to suit different departments. It's interesting to hear about the rigorous compliance processes in the pharmaceutical industry and how you integrated them seamlessly into your workflow. Moving on, could you share more about your experience with Python and R? How have you used these programming languages in your work, particularly in data analysis or developing marketing insights?

7:27

I've used Python and R the Basically, databases so that I could then pull information to make determinations about what was and wasn't working. I do like to use those things because they can be used in conjunction graph databases just because it helps to give a visual view of areas that are sometimes easy to overlook, areas of connections that are easy to overlook. So, again, I use it to extract data, to be able to find out exactly where there are commonalities and where it makes sense to perhaps move into a different market. And being able to use that data in a way that doesn't, where I don't create a narrative, but where I look for the narrative. Because it's easy to see what you want to see in data if you aren't careful and go and balance it against other pieces that are there. So I like to take information from industry. I like to take information from past campaigns and any other areas where I can get it to have a full rounded holistic view. So that when go and present options and things that should be done. It has a clear basis and backing for the why, and it's not a matter of opinion.

8:42

It's clear that you use Python and R effectively to extract and analyze data, helping to identify patterns and connections that might otherwise be missed. I appreciate your emphasis on using data to uncover stories rather than imposing narratives on it. This approach seems to ensure that your insights are well-grounded and objective, providing strong support for your recommendations. As we wrap up the discussion on your technical skills, can you share any specific examples or outcomes where using Python or R significantly influenced a marketing decision or strategy?

9:14

This ties back to what I spoke to before about that example because I do use multiple platforms for whatever I do, so it's hard to narrow that down. But yeah, whenever I'm looking at data, as long as I have a specific, language or specific platform available to me, I like to be able to use it in order to not only extract the data, but be able to make sense of the data and understand what it's telling me. So, the a good example of that ties into the explanation and the example that I gave earlier where I helped to increase, by 15% their sales targets.

9:59

Thank you for circling back to that earlier example. It's evident that your proficiency in Python and R plays an integral role in your ability to analyze data comprehensively and derive actionable insights, which has clearly contributed to achieving significant results. Now, let's move on to a case study based on your experience. Imagine you are tasked with launching a new product in the technology sector. What steps would you take to develop a go-to-market strategy, and how would your previous experiences guide you in this process?

10:29

I'd wanna know what's happening first in the industry since this is a new product, and so there wouldn't be anything to build on in terms of what it's done previously. I would want to see what other products that the company has, launched that might be similar to get information from it. And then a way are possible and where they have that budget to do, market research perhaps even directly talking to who some potential clients or consumers might be to be able to do that. And once I have that information, then decide on who is the demographic who what channels will be reaching them with, which way do we use this information within the channel and being able to separate things out so that as we do create the variety of campaigns, that go into making sure this happens, we're able to maybe not personalized because that's not always easy to do, but we're able to better define who it is that we're trying to reach so that it has a more impactful, impactful place in terms of being able to create the brand awareness and then moving into the value prop where they actually buy whatever product or service it is.

11:51

That sounds like a well-thought-out approach. You emphasize understanding the industry landscape, leveraging past product launches, and possibly conducting market research to gain insights into potential consumers. It's clear that your strategy would focus on defining the target demographic and selecting the most effective channels for outreach. How would you utilize your expertise in data analysis and visualization during this process to ensure the strategy is both data-driven and adaptable to changes in the market?

12:21

Well, taking from all those different paths that I spoke about, I would look at the data from there to be able to determine which what made sense. And I always believe in an approach where you create all the steps and you have a plan but you have to be able to say this part of it isn't working. So it's always launch and test. It's never just launch, hope everything happens. And wishful thinking. So you launch and then you go and test the data against what the projections are. And if for some reason that's not working the way I thought it would, then I look to see where is there a breakdown, where is something wrong, or maybe not something wrong, but where is this not working the way it seems to be? So then go, and continue to to to move along and have that evolution of change within it to say the data is now telling me this. And for this reason, we can make this change or, of course, one can continue along the path and then use all the data that comes from the end of, let's say, a campaign However, I do think it makes more sense to be more iterative and to take information as you see it so that you don't wind up, overspending on your budget for something that isn't working the way you thought it would

13:42

Your iterative approach of launching, testing, and making data-informed adjustments shows a good balance between planning and flexibility. It ensures that strategies remain aligned with actual market dynamics rather than relying solely on initial projections. Now, let's explore a scenario to delve deeper into this concept. Imagine you have launched a product but initial sales and engagement metrics are below expectations. How would you go about analyzing the situation using your expertise in data science and omni-channel marketing? What steps would you take to optimize the strategy?

14:36

Well, I would see exactly where it was being sold, when it was being sold, and how it was being sold. And where the breakdown was happening compared to the projections. And then deciding from there whether it's a matter of it needs to be a different price point Sometimes that can change. Sometimes it can't. Or maybe it's being marketed in the wrong area. Quite often, there I would say, there is always a a client for or a customer for every product But if they don't see it, and they don't understand that it's there, there's no way for them to buy it. So I would look to make adjustments especially as to who is seeing it, what are the demographics that we're the brand recognition is being pushed toward and being able to pivot on that and say, this, based on data we've seen, these are the people that are more like to buy even though it might not have been expected initially. These are the people more likely to buy and being able to, slightly change it campaign to reach an entirely different demographic. And so using, Vape's basic data analysis to be able to see, what's being done where and who's seeing it and who's buying it. Allows me to then make those changes. And I find that, creating graphs to be able to see that, even sometimes, you know, a a simple pie chart or, you know, a a dot chart can really go and show, especially when you have to compare since What exactly is working and where is it not? So this product is being sold and it's being sold well in Texas. But for some reason, people in Wisconsin aren't as interested if you're trying to hit the same demographic Well, then you have to dig deeper and say, well, maybe there's a cultural difference somewhere. So even though you thought this product would work, in a place that seems similar, it does it. And being able to dig out that sub data, you know, going deeper with the data to understand that, you then say, oh, okay. When we sell it in Wisconsin, we have to highlight this point. And this is the demographic that we're trying to reach. So being able to not just look at top surface data, but being able to look at what's underneath and then, Seeing the patterns and seeing where there's a disconnect really helped to be able to make sure that I've always been able to, make changes when needed.

16:45

Thank you for sharing your approach. Your explanation underscores the importance of examining various data layers and being open to discovering unexpected patterns. It's insightful how you focus on understanding not just the numbers, but the underlying reasons behind customer engagement and adapting strategies accordingly. Let's shift gears a bit. Given the breadth of your experience, what would you consider as a particularly challenging or rewarding project in your career, and what did you learn from it?

17:16

I think the most challenging is really, being able to, again, convince stakeholders that the data that you're showing them is something that's worth taking action on. And that's something that's happened multiple. It's not one particular one particular experience. Because once again, when you have various stakeholders within an organization, they're not as used to seeing data and making changes on that quite often. I'm dealing with organizations that are very used to doing things one way, They're comfortable with it. It has worked. And even though they would like to try something new, when they're actually presented with information, they might feel uncomfortable. So being able to see that human aspect and help, to to change minds and to change the way people look at things within an organization that I'm trying to help. Is probably really the most challenging part because I look at the data and I understand it. My teams look at the data and they understand it. But being able to translate that again to different people is sometimes challenging, but I think it's also rewarding. Because it helps me to be a better communicator.

18:28

It's insightful to hear how you view the challenge of aligning stakeholders with data-driven decisions. Navigating through established mindsets and promoting change seems to be both a challenging and rewarding aspect of your work. It's commendable how you use these situations as opportunities to enhance your communication skills. Lastly, looking ahead, is there a particular area or trend within omni-channel marketing or data analytics that excites you or that you see as a potential avenue for growth?

18:57

I think being able to personalize things better and using AI is very exciting. Because the more personalized information or the most targeted information that comes in to a potential client or customer, the more likely they will respond to it. So when you see a ad that looks like it was meant for you, it's not selling a product to everyone that happens to look like you or sound like you are in the same industry that you are. You want to at least know more about the product, if not, buy product or obtain it in some way. So I find that really interesting. Being able to tailor things, quickly and, make it personalized by using AI.

19:40

The potential for AI to enhance personalization in marketing is indeed exciting. Your perspective on how targeted and relevant content can drive engagement and conversion highlights a trend that's reshaping the industry.
